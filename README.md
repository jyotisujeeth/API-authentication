learning and building a API authentication
There are several different ways to authenticate a client when making requests to a REST API. Some common approaches include:

API Key: This is a simple authentication method where the client includes a unique API key in the request header or query string. The server verifies the key and, if it is valid, processes the request.

OAuth: This is a widely used authentication method that allows clients to access resources owned by a third-party API on behalf of the resource owner. It involves obtaining an access token from the API, which the client can then include in the request header to authenticate the request.

Basic Authentication: This is a simple authentication method that involves sending the client's username and password in the request header as base64-encoded values.

Token-Based Authentication: This is a method where the client sends a unique token in the request header to authenticate the request. The token is typically generated by the server and issued to the client after the client has provided its credentials and the server has authenticated them.
